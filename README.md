# Vegetable Classifier Website

This project is part of my submission for DevOps And Automation For AI CA2 submission from Singapore Polytechnic AY23/24. 
This is the front-end part of the project (although technically it's full stack for this part but it's just more of serving web pages), and the back-end is in the other repo called vegetable classifier server. 
This front-end uses flask to serve the web pages, takes in user input (in which case the image and its other details) and sends towards the back-end server to make a prediction.
This front-end server also stores user data such as their past prediction data as well as user accounts.
